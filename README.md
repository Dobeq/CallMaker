# CallMaker
Discord bot to make visible private voice channels.

Creates channels where everybody but the creator is automatically server muted, the creator can always server mute, and nobody else (except admins) can server mute or move people out.

Usage:
  call new: creates a new voice channel with the sender as the owner, if they don't already own one
  call end: destroys any voice channel owned by the sender
  call die: turns off the bot on my computer. I unly just now realised it does this. please don't use this command until I fix that
